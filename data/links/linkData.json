The gaps present between some days are due to me constantly updating the system.\n\nI love taking timelapses of the clouds and sky, and one day I had the idea to create a system that takes high quality timelapses every day and automatically uploads them to YouTube. The system controls a GoPro over WiFi to start, stop, and download the timelapse. Then, it adds music, collects and formats the metadata, and uploads it to Youtube. I'm quite proud of the result, especially given it was my first time coding in Python. Let me know what you think, and if you have any questions or feedback!
