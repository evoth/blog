# Portfolio Site v2

## Plan

A content-rich personal website featuring project posts and descriptions that communicate my problem solving approach and breadth of knowledge.

## Current State

A very empty and feature-incomplete version of the site and structure.

## Todo

- Fix spacing
    - Concept shortcode
- Better responsiveness for mobile
    - Home page
    - Smaller text sizes below medium breakpoint
- Hover cues
- Fix color transition on theme change
    - Disable/reenable transitions on "theme" event
    - Whole page sometimes flashes on reload
- Sufficient button titles (TOC and others)
- References
- Concept framing
- Footer
- Better sidenote location cue? (gwern.net)
- Design and style the website
- Add content
- Change hero color
- Get local copy of Google fonts?
- COMMENT AND ORGANIZE
- ARIA, accessibility in general, Schema, OpenGraph, correct use of tags where possible (semantics), good tooltips and labels, button/link titles, etc.
- Reduce use of pseudo elements
- Correct post published/updated dates (figure out GitInfo with submodules)
- Responsive chip lists
- Darker zinc-300 color? Or maybe add zinc-250 and shift everything down
