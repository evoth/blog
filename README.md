# Portfolio Site v2

## Plan

A content-rich personal website featuring project posts and descriptions that communicate my problem solving approach and breadth of knowledge.

## Current State

An outline of the relationship between posts, concepts, projects, series, and tags.

## Todo

- Design and style the website
- Add content
- Change hero color
- Get local copy of Google fonts?
- Even though plot shortcode is *technically* DRY as it is, should probably try to make that true for the resulting HTML as well
