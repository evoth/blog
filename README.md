# Portfolio Site v2

## Plan

A content-rich personal website featuring project posts and descriptions that communicate my problem solving approach and breadth of knowledge.

## Current State

A very barebones version of the site and structure.

## Todo

- Fix spacing
    - Concept shortcode
- Design and style the website
- Add content
- Change hero color
- Get local copy of Google fonts?
- Even though plot shortcode is *technically* DRY as it is, should probably try to make that true for the resulting HTML as well
- COMMENT AND ORGANIZE
- ARIA, accessibility in general, Schema, OpenGraph, correct use of tags where possible, etc.
- Reduce use of pseudo elements
