# Portfolio Site v2

## Plan

A content-rich personal website featuring project posts and descriptions that communicate my problem solving approach and breadth of knowledge.

## Current State

A very barebones version of the site and structure.

## Todo

- Fix spacing
    - Concept shortcode
- Better responsiveness for mobile
    - Home page
    - Smaller text sizes below medium breakpoint
- Hover cues
- Fix color transition on theme change
    - Disable/reenable transitions on "theme" event
- Better sidenote location cue? (gwern.net)
- Design and style the website
- Add content
- Change hero color
- Get local copy of Google fonts?
- Even though plot shortcode is *technically* DRY as it is, should probably try to make that true for the resulting HTML as well
- # ***COMMENT*** AND ORGANIZE
- ARIA, accessibility in general, Schema, OpenGraph, correct use of tags where possible, etc.
- Reduce use of pseudo elements
