# Portfolio Site v2

## Plan

A content-rich personal website featuring project posts and descriptions that communicate my problem solving approach and breadth of knowledge.

## Current State

A very empty version of the site and structure.

## Todo

- Fix spacing
    - Concept shortcode
- Better responsiveness for mobile
    - Home page
        - Smaller text sizes below medium breakpoint
- Sufficient button titles (TOC and others)
- Concept framing
- Footer
- Better sidenote location cue? (gwern.net)
- Change hero color?
- Get local copy of Google fonts?
- **COMMENT AND ORGANIZE**
    - Especially partials
        - Explain input/output
        - Organize into folders
    - Organize layouts with partials for different sections
- ARIA, accessibility in general, Schema, OpenGraph, correct use of tags where possible (semantics), good tooltips and labels, button/link titles, etc.
- Eliminate last pseudo elements
- Correct post published/updated dates (figure out GitInfo with submodules)
- Darker zinc-300 color? Or maybe add zinc-250 and shift everything down
- Tooltip with image and domain name (or site name if it exists) like Discord
- References behavior more like TOC
- Include references on TOC?
- Heading links
- Series buttons at bottom
- Organize Tailwind mess using components and stuff
- Weird glitch where there's too much padding below references until reflow
- Fix repetitive tooltip.html
- Disable SVG animation and similar for prefers-reduced-motion
- Add content
